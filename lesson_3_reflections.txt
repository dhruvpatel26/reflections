When would you want to create remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Creating a remote repository is useful when you have multiple people working on the same project and need each other to
  instantly see the changes of one another's additions/suggestions to the project.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your 
remote repository?
You always want to pull changes manually so that you can have more control over it. Sometimes you may not need to pull changes
to your local repository and just want the commit on the remote repository, because it may not be that important.
